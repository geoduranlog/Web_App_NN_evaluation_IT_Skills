# Web_App_NN_evaluation_IT_Skills

Web application built using Flask to deploy machine learning models.
The aim is to provide a recommendation for a given (IT skill) input.
The recommendation output is obtained from three different Neural Network models (FastTex, word2vec, GloVe).

The models are not provided in this repository (confidential) neither the full courpus from which such models were trainned (sorry).
